Java Concepts
* Used java.util.Scanner to receive user input
* Used java.util.File to create, add and delete files from a root directory
* Used try catch blocks to handle Exceptions caused by the user inputting non valid inputs
* Used an array to hold the Files to iterate through when searching or displaying file names
* Didn’t have to use a sorting algorithm as the system automatically sorted the files into ascending alphabetical order
